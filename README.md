## Introduction
This project is for organizations or individuals looking to build kiosks. Although it was originally designed for upgrading a batch of thin clients which currently use Windows 7, it could be used in any number of projects. Its also a good way to resurrect old machines which are incapable of running Windows 10 but could be used for thin clients, display boards, or in any number of low-impact kiosk applications.

### What is CCI-Kiosk?

CCI Kiosk, in brief is a script that you run on top of an Ubuntu Server installation. The result is a kiosk which can be used either as a thin client with Citrix/RDP, or as a web kiosk for some sort of web based application.

### Criteria for this project

1. Simple - The UI must be intuitive
2. Sturdy - The user must not have the ability to make customizations or changes to the endpoint
3. Standard - If one breaks you can plug another one in and it will work
4. Standalone - They don't need to be on the corporate network to work
